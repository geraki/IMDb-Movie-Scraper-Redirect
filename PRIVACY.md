IMDb Movie Scraper Button

This Chrome extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

- We do not collect personally identifiable information.
- We do not track browsing activity or behavior.
- We do not store data outside the user’s local browser.
- We only access the current tab’s URL locally to detect IMDb movie IDs.
- All extension settings (like the scraper base URL) are stored locally in the user’s browser using Chrome’s `storage` API.

This extension operates entirely on the client side and does not communicate with any external servers or third-party services.

If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the developer.
